# yonik on Linux

[Русский](linux-ru.md) · [Project home](../../README.md)

Applies to base `db8226ef585b8251fe02ca3dbbe0f7ac759fc636`: Linux,
CachyOS/Arch x86_64, KDE Plasma/Wayland. Android is deferred. The working user
path is local SOCKS5 for explicitly configured applications. System TUN,
DNS/Fake-IP, kill switch and applying application routes through the GUI remain
unavailable (`system_tun=false`). Bundling a helper does not enable these features.
Full P25 acceptance is not claimed: licenses, runtime composition and performance
requirements remain open.

## Build and verify provenance

Use the official [repository](https://github.com/MYRSGRAL/yonik), verify the chosen
commit and Cargo.lock, and run commands from the checkout root. Requirements:
Rust >=1.85 (edition 2024), Qt6 Base/Declarative with Quick, Controls, Widgets,
Network, DBus and QML development tools, a C++ toolchain, SQLite and a compatible
linker (lld/gold/mold). Wayland needs Qt Wayland. Storage requires an existing
configured desktop Secret Service. These commands do not install dependencies.

```sh
git rev-parse HEAD
python tools/install_desktop.py --help
```

On the project workstation use its build slot. Create the directory once and
hold a lock on its root whenever using it:

```sh
yonik_build=/var/tmp/codex-myrs/transient/yonik-user-guide
mkdir -p "$yonik_build"
/home/myrs/projects/yonik/local/orchestration/with-rust-slot flock -s "$yonik_build" env CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$yonik_build/target" CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1 cargo build --locked --release -p yonik-desktop --features gui
```

Another machine may lack this orchestration wrapper: use equivalent local build
concurrency control, retaining flock, an external target and jobs=1. Before
cleanup copy the binary to a permanent directory you own and record source SHA,
toolchain and binary SHA-256. Once all processes using the build have finished,
run `cargo clean` with the same lock and `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`. Leave other temporary
directories alone.

Engines are neither bundled nor downloaded by the build. Obtain official binaries
for your platform and verify their provenance and upstream checksums through the
official supplier channel, then their local SHA-256. The GUI expects these exact
bytes; newer upstream versions or locally adapted builds do not replace its pins:

| Path inside engine-dir | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| `xray-26.10.31/xray` | `cc4b84d3069569f297a61f04b914f2bb37e9d202fd7b84cb50def1fc30fd40e1` |
| `sing-box-1.14.4/sing-box` | `1264361b5f8868c8768f7555d3e77e20118bf503c41ac08bb290a0d99056aa3a` |

The GUI verifies a snapshot and runs config-check before starting. Do not bypass
mismatches. The cleanbuild78 archive from eec7 sources is historical evidence,
not proof of the latest binary.

## Launch and menu entry

Replace these absolute paths with your permanent paths:

```sh
/permanent/path/yonik-desktop --engine-dir /absolute/path/to/engines
python tools/install_desktop.py --binary /permanent/path/yonik-desktop --engine-dir /absolute/path/to/engines
```

The installer only creates a user menu entry and icon; it does not copy binaries,
engines or install the system helper. Run the GUI as your regular user. Default
data location is `$XDG_DATA_HOME/tofu` or `~/.local/share/tofu`;
`--data-dir /absolute/private/path` chooses another directory. The legacy `tofu`
name and Secret Service identity preserve access to encrypted data. If the key
is missing, locked or unavailable, stop and restore access to the original Secret
Service. Do not delete the database/key or create a replacement for an existing
database. There is no plaintext fallback. Keep subscription URLs and credentials
out of argv, logs, screenshots and bug reports.

## Subscription, import and connection

1. Open the server card → **Servers → Add** and paste the subscription URL.
   Adding starts the download. **Advanced → Local source** allows HTTP/local
   addresses only for trusted sources. **Device ID** is off by default; enabling
   sends a random stable ID for that subscription, not a hardware ID. Device-limit
   errors never generate a new ID.
2. In **Review import**, inspect accepted/rejected/flagged counts, issue pages and
   the JSON warning. Approve only trusted sources. **Save profiles** approves the
   report; **Discard import** preserves the previous snapshot. Source JSON
   routes/DNS/inbounds do not become your network settings.
3. Select a server, return home and press the central button. Import support for a
   protocol does not imply engine support for every parameter: incompatibility
   fails explicitly instead of silently weakening TLS.
4. Obtain the SOCKS5 address from **Settings → Connection**, explicitly configure
   the application that should use it and check that application's DNS behavior.
   The OS normally selects a port; `--listen-port 10808` is a diagnostic override.
5. Select the subscription in **Servers** to refresh or cancel its current download.
   **More** offers rename/delete with confirmation. Errors, cancellation and
   discarded imports preserve the last approved snapshot. Deleting a subscription
   removes its servers from this device.

The GUI accepts URLs; there is no separate file picker or manual profile editor.
For offline analysis of a subscription body (URI/Base64/supported JSON), use stdin,
keeping the original file private and outside git:

```sh
/home/myrs/projects/yonik/local/orchestration/with-rust-slot flock -s "$yonik_build" env CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$yonik_build/target" CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1 cargo run --quiet --locked -p yonik-import < /private/path/subscription.txt
```

This produces an analysis report, not a GUI import or activation. Exit 0 includes
reports with rejected records. Limits: 8 MiB input, 32 MiB decoded, 20,000 URIs,
64 KiB per URI, JSON depth 64. See [import limits](../validation/2026-11-09-subscription-import.md).
These paths do not fully satisfy FR-06/07.

The GUI currently selects Direct for downloads. The ManualProxy API requires
explicit trusted DNS configuration for a domain proxy endpoint; that setting has
no GUI wiring yet. Do not assume availability or silently replace failure with
DIRECT. Scheduled refresh requires confirmed power/network/visibility conditions;
unknown conditions block background work (fail closed). Do not rely on refresh
while hidden; refresh manually in the open GUI when needed.

## Status, settings and exit

`Checking` is not success. `Connected` confirms the specific HTTPS endpoint through
the current outbound at check time, not global internet connectivity. `Limited`
leaves the engine running without current HTTPS proof. Reconnect manually after a
network change. TCP in **Diagnostics** measures the server endpoint, not VPN speed.
Set a custom HTTPS URL and expected status 200–299 there. Do not publish tokenized
URLs; the input field clears after submission.

Engine, port, language and safe check URLs persist in preferences. URLs containing
query, credentials or fragment are session-only; restart uses the saved safe/default
endpoint. Preserve the original preferences file on read/write errors and resolve
permissions/access instead of deleting it. The routing editor saves a draft only;
**Apply to network** is disabled. Draft rules do not control the running SOCKS
session or application traffic.

Closing the window with a working tray can hide it and leave the session running.
Choose **Quit** in the tray for full exit and wait for shutdown. Relaunching with
the same data-dir restores the existing instance. `CleanupError` means cleanup is
unconfirmed: repeat Stop if offered and retain a sanitized error description.
Do not report successful disconnection or manually flush network state.

The safeCopy change in **#82 is pending**, not merged into this base; availability
in current main is not promised. Independently check diagnostics for secrets
before sharing.

## Package install, update, rollback and removal

The [Arch recipe](../../packaging/arch/README.md) pins **e33fa190**, not this guide's
base. It builds GUI/helper/worker; engine runtime is supplied separately. Follow
the recipe in a disposable VM without `makepkg -i/-s`. Validate the archive first:

```sh
python tools/check_arch_package.py /absolute/path/yonik.pkg.tar.zst
```

The validator checks allowlist/permissions/metadata/ELF magic, not binary authenticity
or functionality. Verify provenance separately. The clean-VM install/update/rollback
matrix remains incomplete; this is not an accepted host installer. For your own
verified package, normal package-manager actions in the VM are
`sudo pacman -U /absolute/path/yonik.pkg.tar.zst` and `sudo pacman -R yonik`.
These mutate the system and were not executed here. There are no auto-start hooks,
but an explicit client request can activate the D-Bus service. Do not run the
helper manually or create an engine registry through workaround commands. The
system registry requires a separate trusted supplier; user engine-dir does not
authorize helper engines. Avoid `curl | sh`, broad sudo workarounds, flushing
nftables/routes or changing the keyring to bypass errors.

Before update/removal, stop the session and Quit. Retain the previous verified
binary/package and a private consistent backup of data while the application is
closed; the original Secret Service key must remain accessible. For user-launcher
rollback, restore the previous binary and rerun menu installation with its path.
For packages, use `pacman -U` with the previous verified archive in the VM. Old
binaries may not support a newer database schema: never open the only data copy
with an older version. Restore a matching backup separately without replacing
the key.

To remove the user launcher, remove only its created
`applications/cloud.highpriority.yonik.desktop` and
`icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/cloud.highpriority.yonik.svg` under XDG data home,
after checking ownership and the entry's managed marker. Preserve unrelated files.
You may separately remove your own binary. Preserve databases, user data and keys.
Package removal does not promise active-network cleanup; do not manually delete
`/run`, other resources or keyring data.
